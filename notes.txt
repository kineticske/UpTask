about flash connection 
1. need to connect in index, previous need to install
2. switch in local variable with res.local.messages and send back a request of object flash when is used 
3. In the specific controller if catch some error go to create a flash error object in wich 
    running around the errors array and you must use map method to get all errors
    then, you must send to the view messages as a req.flash()

special note: flash use sequelize validation
